CS 230 Module One Assignment Guidelines and Rubric
Overview
Software is more about design and organization than about the language and syntax rules of curly braces and semicolons. You should be able to look at a UML class diagram and picture the code that is built from it. Conversely, given a set of classes, you should be able to create a UML class diagram from them. There are even commercial tools that can do that translation back and forth for you: from diagram to code and back.

Now that you have downloaded the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the integrated development environment (IDE), Eclipse, to your desktop, you will use this as an opportunity to examine the source code files to create a UML class diagram.

Prompt
Getting Set Up
Please note: You should have completed these steps during the Technology Setup task.

If you have not already done so, download the zipped file folder that contains the source code files from Hands-on Design Patterns With Java: Chapter 2 (Bicycle.java, Driver.java, TwoWheeled.java, and Vehicle.java). Please note: The Driver.java class is the program driver.
Open your IDE, Eclipse, and create a new Java project.
Upload the zipped file folder with the Java code into the Eclipse project. A tutorial is available for uploading files to Eclipse: Uploading Files to Eclipse Desktop Version Tutorial PDF.
UML Class Diagram

Examine the source code and classes.
Develop a UML class diagram for the application using Lucidchart. A tutorial for creating a free Lucidchart account to design UML diagrams is available: Lucidchart Tutorial for Creating Class Diagrams PDF.
Your class diagram must include all classes and demonstrate the relevant object-oriented programming principles.
Briefly describe the object-oriented programming principles illustrated in the class diagram.
What to Submit
Submit a Microsoft Word document that includes an image of the UML class diagram you created and a brief write-up.
